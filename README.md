# MSU-IIT's Online Discuss Hub.:school:
This is the repository for an open-source project so that I can help to create a discussion hub for my university. 
This was inspired from different apps, especially social media apps *whispers: Most likely Reddit and Discord*. 
For now, it is under development and much need of testing. So you won't be seeing a realized web app soon. :sweat_smile:
